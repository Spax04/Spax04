 Hi, I'm Alexander Gotlib

Hi there, I'm a full-stack developer based in Israel with a passion for building web applications using modern technologies. My primary programming languages are C# and I have experience working with frameworks such as ASP.NET Core, Angular, and ReactJS.

My skills: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33599251/219962585-3911a5e0-040a-453c-b0ee-bcb51100c785.png)


I enjoy taking on complex problems and finding elegant solutions that deliver real value to end users. I'm a big believer in the power of agile methodologies and collaborative teamwork, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn from others.

When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me exploring new places and trying out different activities. I'm also a big fan of staying active and spending time outdoors.

Feel free to check out my Github profile for examples of my work and to get in touch with me if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project.
